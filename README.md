# Tic_Tac_Toe

A tic tac toe is a very well known game which is being played by people all around the globe.
It is a very basic rather board game which goes this way:


The game consists of 9 squares as shown in the image file named "TTT_Board.JPG".

It is a 2player game, where each player chooses their own random character
and places that in one of the squares turn by turn, such that
a player can fill only one square at a time.

The one who completes a triplet, i.e. Three characters connected in a straight line,
whether it be horizontal, vertical or diagonal, WINS.

If no squares are empty and no winner is decided yet, the game is considered tie.

My code generates a real-time tic tac toe game with computer(very close to AI) using basic java terminal window interface.
